# food2play
Cutiehack 2023 hackathon project

Are you a big foodie? Do you love listening to music and finding new bops to turn up to? Look no further, Food2Play is just for you!
Food2Play is a website that takes recipes from the internet and transforms them into a generated Spotify playlist. Find and discover new music you would have never otherwise listened to while cooking the meal that the playlist is inspired by!
